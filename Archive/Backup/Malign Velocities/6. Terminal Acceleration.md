# 6. 终端加速 Terminal Acceleration
>当我谈论 "屎 "时，这并不是一个比喻： 资本主义把一切都归结为粪便，也就是说，归结为无差别、无编码的流的状态，每个人都必须以一种私人的方式，带着一种罪责感，在其中扮演自己的角色。————费利克斯-瓜塔里1

世事皆屎。然而，终端加速主义却将这些粪便视为阿兰-巴迪欧（Alain Badiou）所说的 "营养分解（nourishing decomposition）"；2 是冲破失败资本主义的枯燥状态（sterility）和跃入新未来的机会。我想分析（analyse）或肛爱（anal/yes）这种 "粪便愿景"，它是当代加速主义的标志性形式之一。与德勒兹、瓜塔里或奈格里等思想家无情的积极性不同，这里的加速之路在于资本主义的消极性和虚无主义。我们已经看到让-鲍德里亚（Jean Baudrillard）是这一形式的关键人物之一，但我想回到两个更早的时刻来追踪消极与世界末日的交汇。这就是乔治-巴塔耶（Georges Bataille）1930 年代的作品和让-吕克-戈达尔（JeanLuc Godard）1967 年的电影《周末》（*Weekend*）。如果说汽车是现代主义速度的典范，那么戈达尔的《周末》则以其著名的单个追踪镜头展现了长达八分多钟的交通堵塞，暗示了这一典范的终结。这部影片的片名也是 "一部在废墟上发现的影片（A FILM FOUND ON A SCRAP-HEAP）"，考虑到影片上演了一场名副其实的粪便启示录，我们可以将其改写为 "一部在粪便废墟上发现的影片（A FILM FOUND ON A SHIT-HEAP）"。

戈达尔的这部影片明显参考了乔治-巴塔耶（Georges Bataille）。"anal/yes"这一意象出现在科琳娜的独白之前--这是一种幻想、噩梦或现实--其中描述的性爱场面刻意模仿了巴塔耶 1928 年的小说《眼睛的故事》（*Story of the Eye*）中的肛门色情（这一意象也出现在维基百科的影片文化参考资料中）。我们还可以补充一个更深奥的参考资料，即 "艾米莉-布伦特"（Emily Brönte）作为一个人物出现在影片中，而巴塔耶的《文学与邪恶》（*Literature and Evil*，1957 年）中的一个 "案例研究 "就是专门针对她的作品的。在更广泛的层面上，我们可以说戈达尔发展了巴塔耶的 "异质（heterological）"观点，巴塔耶在 20 世纪二三十年代就阐明了这种观点，即 "排泄物力量的侵袭（an irruption of excremental forces）"使价值失效。3 在巴塔耶的 "排泄物马克思主义 "中，革命从 "无产者的唯物主义肠道（materialist bowels of proletarians）"（35）中爆发，而阶级斗争，对巴塔耶和戈达尔来说，是排泄物的启示，在其中一切都变成了粪便。

这种粪便形成了一个模棱两可和逆转的场所：从危机和浪费的肛门资本主义到革命，革命将加速超越资本主义产生的 "有限（limited）"浪费，而这种浪费始终从属于价值。通过这种方式，加速主义可以将生产力的世界末日可能性与毁灭的世界末日可能性交织在一起。如果正如奥地利经济学家约瑟夫-熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）所言，资本主义危机是通过周期性的 "创造性破坏（creative destruction）"来运作的，4 那么这种形式的终极加速主义旨在超越资本主义本身。
## 在泥泞中挣扎 Wallowing in the Mud
在 1929 年一篇题为《花语》（The Language of Flowers）的文章中，巴塔耶写道，不幸的是，这篇文章是伪造的

>萨德侯爵与疯子关在一起，他把最美丽的玫瑰送到他面前，摘下花瓣扔进装满液体粪肥的沟里--在这种情况下，这种令人不安的举动难道不会产生压倒性的影响吗？(14)

萨德这一举动对巴塔耶的影响在于，它证实了他对 "卑贱的唯物主义（base materialism）"的引用，即回归排泄物以消解美和价值。这就是为什么巴塔耶会责备尼采 "完全不能沉湎于泥潭（altogether incapable of wallowing in the mud）"（39）。与尼采试图构成 "超人（overman，übermensch）"的可能性不同，巴塔耶的视野是 "下人（underman）"：将 "人"拖入排泄物中。

在 20 世纪二三十年代，巴塔耶提出了他后来称之为 "普遍经济（general economy）"的观点，这种观点 "建立"在排泄物、反常现象以及所有无法与效用相协调的元素之中，它打破了资本主义的限制性经济。我认为，他在 1929 年华尔街大崩盘后资本主义陷入世界性萧条的同时提出这一理论并非巧合。这种 "异论（heterology）"起到了 "泄殖腔（cloacal）"批判的作用，它针对的是价值积累和劳动的稳定化。巴塔耶的唯物主义不仅打破了稳定的经济形象，也打破了稳定的物质形象。在巴塔耶看来，唯物主义者往往把物质的位置从下至上颠倒过来，从而把物质变成了 "死神"。与此相反，巴塔耶认为，"衰老的唯心主义（senile idealism）"的破坏要求我们将物质视为不稳定、活跃和过度的（15）。我们必须把所有的理想和价值观都拖入泥潭。

当然，正如让-约瑟夫-古（Jean-Joseph Goux）所指出的那样，巴塔耶的过剩经济可能会对致力于积累的资本主义新教伦理的禁欲主义产生影响，但它似乎与 "后现代 "的过剩资本主义有着奇怪的一致性。唐-辛普森是 20 世纪 80 年代和 90 年代初所谓 "高概念 "电影的制片人，如《比佛利山警探》（*Beverly Hills Cop*，1984 年）和《壮志凌云》（*Top Gun*，1986 年），如果我们读一读他的生平故事，我们就会明白，僭越的世界观是如何符合资本主义作为解放和过度的幻想式自我形象的。6 辛普森的惩罚性过度制度--从毒品和妓女，到锻炼和整容--涉及他对自己身体的物质性的研究，以使自己成为 "完美的 "资本主义主体。我们还可以从更普通的事实入手，即那些被资本主义抛弃的 "剩余人类（surplus humanity）"往往生活在排泄物之中。7排泄物和反常现象并没有为资本主义现代性开辟出另一个空间，而是被编入了资本主义现代性的代码，成为其固有的、被许可的僭越行为，从而与价值生产重新联系在一起，但却是在 "纯粹"投机和过剩的层面上。所谓的 "合理投资（sound investment）"可以变成排泄物，但排泄物或废物也可以突然变成投机资源。

巴塔耶批判的僵局不仅在于它已被 "泄殖腔 "资本主义（一种在过剩和浪费中繁荣的资本主义）所超越。更具破坏性的问题在于，它将这种过剩或浪费视为新生产的场所，这似乎很难与资本主义决裂。这是一种倒置的或消极的生产主义，它将破坏加速到 "更高的"太阳过剩水平--一种终极加速。这种生产主义让人看不出巴塔耶如何能如鲍德里亚所愿，被用来打破 "生产之镜 "8。巴塔耶的观点模棱两可，他的确可以被解读为对一种新的生产形式的赞美，但他的作品也暗示了生产内部的危机。与其说巴塔耶提供了另一种浪费原则，不如说他从内部破坏了生产，侵蚀或削弱了生产的能力。他使用了 "腐烂的太阳（rotten sun）"这一形象，通过将过剩拖入腐烂的基础物质中，暗示了对太阳过剩的这种模棱两可的破坏（57-58）。巴塔耶试图完成一项不可能完成的任务，即把上升与突然下降结合起来思考。

巴塔耶沿着 "排泄物 "的路线飞行，表明了试图找到一种对加速主义和生产动力的绝对抵抗的困难。如果我们建立一个废物原则，那么我们就会发现这个原则被逆转为 "营养分解"。巴塔耶的 "解决方案 "并没有完全解决传统意义上的问题，而是提出了一个可逆的时刻，它存在于任何 "生产性 "话语或实践之中。在这一时刻，消极和积极可以突然发生灾难性的位置转换。然而，从当代资本主义不断变化的 "动力（dynamics）"中提取这种可能性的困难依然存在。
## 野蛮还是野蛮？ Barbarism or Barbarism?
Godard’s Weekend concerns a bourgeois couple, Roland and Corinne, who are driving to
Corinne’s father to collect her inheritance. Both have secret lovers, both are plotting to
murder each other, and both are happy to murder Corinne’s father if necessary to claim the
inheritance. Their journey through France rapidly descends into anarchy as the bourgeois
social-order falls apart around them. Here the excremental is revolutionary – the apocalyptic
crisis of the bourgeoisie. Godard casts this crisis in the satirical form of cannibal
revolutionaries – the ‘Seine-et-Oise Liberation Front’ (FLSO) – who dominate the closing
sequences of the film. Quasi-hippy revolutionaries, dressed in parodic Native American
costume, the FLSO provide a literalization of the metaphor of ingestion, not so much digging
the grave of the bourgeois world as consuming and voiding it.
In fact, as Godard’s film registers, this ‘excremental vision’ is split: we have the
revolutionary anality of Bataille, in which the heterological forces open a reenchantment and
resacralization of reality, but also the anality of capitalist production, with its cycles of
digestion and voiding in ‘creative destruction’. Godard reproduces explicitly the tension we
noted in Bataille, in which revolution and creative destruction intertwine and merge in new
forms of destructive consumption. In fact the cannibal is at once the irrecuperable figure of
extremity and the figure of an auto-consumptive capital.
Norman O. Brown’s Life against Death (1959) analyses this split vision in his, now contested,
reading of Jonathan Swift. For Brown, Swift’s ‘excremental vision’ reveals the anality of
culture and the psyche. In Brown’s words, ‘for Swift [scatological imagery] … becomes the
decisive weapon in his assault on the pretensions, the pride, even the self-respect of
mankind.’9 And yet the revelation by Swift of the excremental core that wrecks human
dignity is also the historical revelation of the anal economy of capitalism itself. Eli Zaretsky
notes: ‘Capitalism at root, Brown argued, was socially organized anality: beneath the pseudoindividuated genitality of early modern society, its driving force was literally the love of
shit’.10 The chapter on Weekend in the discussion between Kaja Silverman and Harun Farocki
on Godard is titled ‘Anal Capitalism’.11
If the excremental is under the sign of the sacred then it displays the typical equivocation
of the sacred: revolutionary or bourgeois, terminal regression or rebirth? If the ‘driving force’
of capitalism is ‘the love of shit’ then this ‘driving force’ is appropriately figured in the
equivocal status of the car, which in Weekend is both ‘treasured commodity’ and ‘worthless
junk’.12 The ‘weekend’ break from production leads to the heterological space of stasis, in
which production is reversed into voiding; the traffic jam is the blockage of this driving force,
the indigestible moment of failed flow and the accumulation of the excremental. The famous
long tracking-shot of the traffic jam, as Brian Henderson points out, finds its future echo in
the tracking-shot of the car production-line in British Sounds (1970).13 Again Godard plays on
the reversal of production and destruction, production and anti-production, value and waste.
He injects, as Bataille did with his thinking of instability, an oscillation into this vision of
excremental vitalism.
The equivocation of the ‘driving force’ of capitalism – the question whether this anal
economy of incorporation, digestion, and excretion that Bataille traces can be derailed into an
ecstatic and apocalyptic voiding – is redoubled in the moment of the scatological apocalypse.
We equivocate on the waste of a decomposing culture. Does Godard offer us ‘a nourishing
decomposition’, are we merely mired in the scrap-heap? In Swift’s words, will we find ‘Such
gaudy Tulips rais’d from Dung’?14 Weekend implies is that we no longer have socialism or
barbarism, but barbarism per se; but it is this barbarism that seems to be the only way to
socialism? Harun Farocki argues that: ‘there is the suggestion that under the thin veneer of
this “civilization” beats the heart of a more affectively vital “barbarism.”’15 For Godard’s
‘revolutionaries’, ‘We can only overcome the horror of the bourgeoisie by even more horror.’16
This could well be the motto, avant la lettre, of terminal accelerationism.
The lesson of Weekend, which is why it resonates in the present moment, is that an
excremental vitalism emerges in terminal crisis. In Bataille’s formulation, the revelation of ‘a
disagreeable and terminal stagnation’ destroys ‘the prestige of industrial reality’.17 This is the
promise that, as Robin Wood puts it, ‘Weekend is not about the end of the world – it is simply
about the end of our world.’18 In a rather touching remark, Wood continues: ‘The film
postulates, rather convincingly, the irrelevance, uselessness, and ultimate disintegration of
everything I have always believed in, worked for, and found worth living for, and I don’t
think I can be unique or even unusual in this.’19 The apocalypse is limited to the end of the
bourgeois world, and out of the shit the rebirth of a new vital order.
The horror of vital barbarism predicts a new impassioned future. This chimes with the
remark of the nineteenth-century socialist William Morris, after reading Richard Jefferies
apocalyptic novel After London (1885), that:
I have no more faith than a grain of mustard seed in the future history of “civilization”,
which I know now is doomed to destruction, and probably before very long: what a joy it
is to think of! and how often it consoles me to think of barbarism once more flooding the
world, and real feelings and passions, however rudimentary, taking the place of our
wretched hypocrisies.20
Barbarism is regeneration. The difficulty is that Godard represents the ‘new world’ as one of
stasis and drift and not a world of ‘real feelings and passions’. The cannibal revolutionaries
feast on the remains of the old order, literally, and live lives that are hardly passionate.
While the promise is that one world will end in horror to give birth to a vital and
passionate new world, presumably without horror, it seems unlikely, in Godard’s film, that
horror will peaceably disappear. Although Weekend appeared just before the events of May
’68, which would reinvigorate ‘the passion for the real’, in Godard’s film this revolutionary
passion takes the terminal form of cannibal extinction. His cannibal revolutionaries are
studied hippie primitivists, who play drums, rape their captives, and are served their meals by
the cook in blood-stained apron. The dialectic in the revolutionary ‘passion for the real’
between voluntarist vitalism and historicist confirmation is ruptured in Godard’s film through
a regression. In this regression ‘vitality’ detaches itself from history and pulverizes history
into a mythic space of social degree-zero and auto-consumption.
If capitalism is all shit, if we have an ‘anal capitalism’ that levels all into general
equivalence, then the end of everything is required in a final voiding. The apocalyptic tone is
required prior to some ‘future’, a full decomposition to consume that rotting culture. Godard,
as Silverman notes ‘launches an extended assault upon all forms of abstraction.’21 With
abstraction, itself the organization of levelling and equivalence through value, voided, we
have what appears to be another abstraction of absolute barbarism. This voiding and levelling
of abstraction takes its own revenge, as a kind of capitalist nihilism or exhaustion that turns
the film once again into shit. The signs equivocate again, and the ‘liberation’ of the anal, of
the ‘excremental forces’, is, to again quote Silverman, ‘not the utopian sexual liberation hailed
by Hocquenghem thirty years ago, but the catastrophic end of all singularity. What we might
call “anal capitalism” decrees the commensurability of “male” and “female,” but only by
consigning both, along with Weekend itself, to the cosmic scrap heap.’22 The apocalypse
reveals then not another revolutionary order, the film as gate to May ’68 which redeems its
hippy-cannibal revolutionaries into the ‘good hippies’ of libidinal revolt, but watched again at
the point of the voiding of the capitalist order in crisis, seems also to reveal a terminal
levelling of capital itself.
Does the equivocation of satire have to be met with a full politicization to escape the
relentless dialectic of reversal between satire and object? For Godard Weekend was his last
film before the collective experiment of political filmmaking the Dziga-Vertov Group. Writing
in 1973, Thomas M. Kavanagh argues Godard’s turn to explicitly political and didactic cinema
as the only possible response to the fact that the bourgeoisie adored Weekend.23 The
commercial and critical success of Weekend would lead Godard to depart for the austerity and
collective practice of his explicitly political filmmaking of the early 1970s.
Recuperation and re-digestion; an anal biopolitical economy à la Pasolini’s film Salo (1975)
beckons. The irrecuperable ‘foreign body’ becomes an object of jouissance, of self-disgust that
returns to bourgeois narcissism. Revolution itself is circular: ‘There is even the familiar
suggestion, rendered concretely in the film in terms of similarities and parallels in their
rituals – eggs and fish between girls’ thighs – that the revolutionary society will be another
formulation of the murderously bourgeois one we knew already.’24 Godard’s escape out of
this circle of consumption was an indigestible political austerity that could not, he felt, be
capitalized on.
And yet the collapse of Godard’s political certainties and those of his critics re-locate the
satire or parody of Weekend in our moment: the Weekend of crisis, the bursting of the bubble,
abandonment of house and car as debt-loaded ‘hostile objects’.25 Excremental or cannibal
hostility now shapes the decomposing culture of capitalism. The impasse of Godard’s film was
to be saved through political praxis, but the decomposition of capitalism and of that praxis
makes the ‘levelling’ of Weekend if not ‘radically funny’, at least necessary again. In this way
it is the terminal document of negative accelerationism. It is at once its most extreme satiric
form, but tips over into the abstract voiding that figures our moment.
